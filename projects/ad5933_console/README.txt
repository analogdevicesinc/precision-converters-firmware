Evaluation Boards/Products Supported
------------------------------------ 
AD5933
AD5934

Recommended Evaluation Board DIGILENT PMOD IA
 
Overview
--------
This is a console application to evalute the AD5933/34 device.
This code was developed and tested on SDP-K1 controller board: https://os.mbed.com/platforms/SDP_K1/ 
with the Digilent PMOD IA board connected to it.
Use of Mbed platform allows code to port on other Mbed supported target boards with little or no modifications.
