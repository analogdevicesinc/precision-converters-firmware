Evaluation Boards/Products Supported
------------------------------------ 
DC2873A-B/LTC2688
DC2904A-B/LTC2686

 
Overview
--------
This is a console application to evalute the LTC2688 using DC2873A-B/DC2904A-B evaluation board.
This code was developed and tested on SDP-K1 controller board: https://os.mbed.com/platforms/SDP_K1/.
Use of Mbed platform allows code to port on other Mbed supported target boards with little or no modifications.
