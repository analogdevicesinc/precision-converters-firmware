Introduction
============

This page gives an overview of using the ARM platforms supported (default is Mbed) 
firmware example with Analog Devices AD4696 Evaluation board and SDP-K1 controller board. 
This example code leverages the ADI developed IIO (Industrial Input Output) ecosystem to 
evaluate the AD4696 device by providing a device debug and data capture support.

The interface used for communicating with PC based IIO clients is either Virtual Serial Or UART. 
IIO Firmware leverages the ADI created no-os and platform driver software layers
to communicates with IIO device.

====================
Hardware Connections
====================

Required: SDP-K1 (or alternative Mbed enabled controller board, or an STM32 board ), EVAL-AD4696 board
and USB cable.

Connect the EVAL-AD4696 board to SDP-K1 board (or any other Mbed enabled controller 
board or an equivalent STM32 board). Connect controller board to the PC using the USB cable.

Jumper Settings
===============

**Power Connections**

* Connect a 12V (1A max) DC power supply to board through VPWR and GND4 pin.
* Connect the VCC_HOST pin of the AD4696 to the 3.3V supply.
* Note: Make sure to connect the 12V DC power supply to VPWR before supplying 
  3.3v to the VCC_HOST pin to adhere to the power-supply-sequence requirement
	
**SDP-K1:**

Connect the VIO_ADJUST jumper on the SDP-K1 board to 3.3V position to drive SDP-K1 GPIOs at 3.3V

**EVAL-AD4696:**

.. note::
   Make below jumper settings on the board. Refer `EVAL-AD4696-FMCZ User Manual <https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad4696.html#eb-overview>`_  for more details.
