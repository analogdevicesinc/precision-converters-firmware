<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page focuses on the IIO firmware part of ‘Data Capturing. The “AD7606 IIO Application”
is used as a reference for this discussion.</p>
<p>IIO clients can be used to capture and visualize the continuous analog or
discrete signals from any ADC device using a IIO firmware application developed
for that particular device. This allows user to monitor a real-time data. Using
this firmware, a user can perform device calibration, change the gain, voltage
range, data rate, etc. (based on device used) and observe the effects that different
configurations have on the data displayed on IIO client. IIO clients
also allows users to save the data, which can further be used to process and analyze it.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the continuous capture of signals on an AD7606 ADC, which
is an 8-channel DAS. A 1Khz signal is applied on inputs of all 8 analog channels.
The max data capturing rate in firmware is ~30 to 40 KSPS. The data is transmitted
from firmware application using Virtual Serial or UART serial link.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/iio_osc_sine_wave_capture.png"><img alt="../../_images/iio_osc_sine_wave_capture.png" src="../../_images/iio_osc_sine_wave_capture.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>

<p>The channels for which data is to be captured can be selected from the GUI window,
along with the number of samples to display on screen in a single data read query.
As shown below, all 8 channels are selected for data capture and the number of
requested samples is set at 400 (default). This means, IIO oscilloscope requests
400 samples per channel, so in this case total 3200 samples. The channels are
stored as shown below:</p>

<h3>Saving Captured Data<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-captured-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The data on IIO oscilloscope can be saved for further processing and analysis. The
data is saved using a .csv format. The data can be captured for each selected
channel during save option and only requested number of samples can be saved. So
if 400 samples are requested, the data for only 400 samples would get saved into
.csv file. The data is raw adc data and no extra processing is performed it while
saving or capturing.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Data Capture Using IIO Application<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-of-data-capture-using-iio-application" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 major factors which can potentially impact the data capturing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sampling/Capturing Rate of ADC</p></li>
<li><p>Data Transmission Rate (serial link) of MCU</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer size limitations in the firmware (MCU RAM size)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ADC Data Sampling/Capturing Rate:</strong></p>
<p>The data capturing or sampling rate defines the maximum rate/speed at which data
can be sampled and captured from the ADC using the IIO firmware application. For
ADC’s, typical time to capture single ADC sample is defined as:</p>
<p>Time to capture single sample: ADC acquisition time + ADC sampling time + ADC data read time over digital interface</p>
<p>For AD7606, this time is typically 28usec for all 8-channels (obtained in IIO firmware).
AD7606 captures all 8-channels in single conversion cycle. When calculating the
sample rate per second, it is obtained as ~284 KSPS for all 8 channels
(28usec / 8 = 3.5usec. Sample rate/second = 1/3.5usec = 284 KSPS). This gives
sample rate per channel as ~35KSPS.</p>
<p>Data capturing rate is also limited because of an additional overhead in the MCU firmware
such as interrupt context switching time, SPI (digital interface) clock frequency, MCU clock speed, etc.</p>
<p>35Khz therefore can be considered as the sampling frequency. As per ‘Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem’,
the sampling frequency should theoretically be greater than twice the analog input
frequency for faithful reproduction of the signal after conversion. However, in
practice sampling frequency should be high enough to capture multiple slices/samples
in given period, so that the input signal is replicated smoothly.</p>
<p>Due to this limitations, IIO firmware can sample input frequencies which are very
less than max possible data rate. In case of AD7606, it is possible to sample the
signals with frequencies of 4Khz and less when no oversampling is present. At OSR &gt; 0,
the data rate drops down and so higher frequency signals can’t be reproduced correctly.
Below plot is captured with 17Khz analog input on channel 1 and it can be seen that
the signal is not a pure sine wave.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/iio_osc_high_frequency_graph.png"><img alt="../../_images/iio_osc_high_frequency_graph.png" src="../../_images/iio_osc_high_frequency_graph.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Data Transmission Rate (serial link) of MCU:</strong></p>
<p>This is the rate or speed at which data can be transmitted to IIO client
over the serial link (e.g. UART or Virtual serial). The data transmission link
must be fast enough the transmit the buffered data from firmware for continuous capture.
The IIO clients requests data in aperiodic manner, meaning that new data
capture request is sent immediately when data from previous request is received.</p>
<p>Capturing Rate &lt; Transmission Rate:</p>
<p>If data capturing rate is lower than transmission rate, the IIO client can wait for
certain period of time before sufficient samples are captured in the buffer. If
time to capture these samples is higher than IIO client timeout period, the
IIO client aborts the request and attempt new capture request. Therefore user must
always ensure that the timeout factor of IIO clients is large enough to handle
slower sampling rates (ODRs) of ADCs.</p>
<p>Main factor that determines the IIO oscilloscope timeout is ‘sampling_frequency’ attribute.
If this attribute is not defined, the timeout period for IIO oscilloscope during
data capture is set to 2sec default, however, if this attribute is defined, the
time is calculated as: number of requested samples * (1 / sampling_frequency).
For example, if sampling frequency is set as 400SPS, the timeout period is:</p>
<p>timeout = 400 (requested samples) * (1 / 10000 SPS) + 1sec = 1.4 sec</p>
<p>Capturing Rate &gt; Transmission Rate:</p>
<p>If data capturing rate is too high compared to the transmission rate, the data
acquisition into a buffer happens faster. So data buffer might fill faster compared
to emptying operation. This might lead to a discontinuity on data visualization
on IIO oscilloscope side as data visualization is limited by data transmission
rate in this case (with slower serial communication link). If communication link
is faster and matches to capturing/sampling rate, the visualization of data would
be more continuous. Having a large data buffer in the firmware can minimize this
issue to large extend but it can’t completely solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Buffer size limitations in the firmware:</strong></p>
<p>Size of data buffer on the firmware is always restricted due to MCU memory size.
The requested number of samples from IIO client application therefore must always
be less than the total size of data buffer. If requested samples are more than
the size of data buffer, IIO firmware returns negative error code to IIO client
which then terminates the data capture request.</p>
<p>Buffer size can be increased to larger value by making use of interna/external
RAMs. For example, SDP-K1 MCU board has 16Mbytes of onboard SDRAM, which allows
larger data buffer size in the firmware. By enabling SDRAM in the SDP-K1 targetted
Mbed firmware (app_config.h file), the data buffer size can be increased to 16Mbytes.</p>

<span class="c1">//#define USE_SDRAM     // Uncomment to use SDRAM for data buffer</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>IIO firmware maintains the circular data buffer with dedicated read and write indices.
Below diagram illustrates the use of circular buffer in the firmware.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>IIO clients can be used to load and stream data to DAC devices using an IIO
firmware application developed for that device. Using this firmware, a user
can configure various settings on the device and load the data using the DAC
Data Manager tab. The data is transmitted using Virtual Serial or UART serial
link. The input data to be streamed can be loaded in a binary data file or a MAT
file (.mat) format.</p>
<p>The channels for which data is to be streamed can be selected from the GUI window,
and the number of samples per channel will be taken from the input data file provided.
So, for an 8-channel DAC, if all 8 channels are selected for streaming, the input
file should contain 3200 samples, considering 400 samples per channel.</p>
<p>IIO client allows data to be streamed to the iio device in two ways: either cyclic
streaming enabled or disabled. When the cyclic buffer streaming is
enabled, the buffer repeats itself, and the same data is streamed over and over
indefinitely until stopped.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Data Streaming Using IIO Application<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-of-data-streaming-using-iio-application" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>DAC Sampling/Update Rate:</strong></p>
<p>The sampling rate or update rate defines the maximum rate/speed at which data can
be loaded and updated onto the DAC output using the IIO firmware application. For
DACs, typical time to update single sample is defined as:</p>
<p>Time to update single sample: DAC data write time over digital interface + DAC conversion &amp; output response time</p>
<p>Data update rate is also limited because of additional overhead in the MCU firmware,
such as interrupt context switching time, SPI (digital interface) clock frequency,
MCU clock speed, etc.</p>
<p>The “AD579X IIO Application” is used as a reference here.
For AD5790, which is a one-channel VDAC, the update rate is 71.4 KSPS. So, if a
sine wave with 200 data points is to be streamed, the output frequency
that can be seen will be 357 Hz (fo = fs/np = Sample rate/number of data points =
71.4K/200). The effective output frequency might also vary based on the number of
channels enabled on the device.</p>
<p><strong>Data Transmission Rate (serial link) of MCU:</strong></p>
<p>This is the rate or speed at which data can be transmitted from the IIO client over
the serial link (e.g. UART or Virtual serial). This especially needs to be considered
when cyclic buffer streaming is disabled and the buffer data needs to be transferred
from the client in real-time for a continuous update.</p>
<p><strong>Buffer size limitations in the firmware:</strong></p>
<p>Size of data buffer on the firmware is always restricted due to MCU memory size.
The required number of samples to be streamed from the IIO client application
therefore must always be less than the total size of data buffer. If the
required streaming samples number is more than the size of data buffer, IIO
firmware returns negative error code to IIO client which then terminates the
data streaming request.</p>
<p>Buffer size can be increased to larger value by making use of internal/external RAMs.
For example, SDP-K1 MCU board has 16Mbytes of onboard SDRAM, which allows larger data
buffer size in the firmware. By enabling SDRAM in the SDP-K1 targeted Mbed firmware
(app_config.h file), the data buffer size can be increased to 16Mbytes.</p>
