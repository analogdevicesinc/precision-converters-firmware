============
Introduction
============

This page gives an overview of using the ARM platforms supported (default is Mbed) 
firmware example with Analog Devices AD7134 Evaluation board and SDP-K1 controller board. 
This example code leverages the ADI developed IIO (Industrial Input Output) ecosystem to 
evaluate the AD7134 device by providing a device debug and data capture support.

The firmware supports mbed and STM32 platforms. The respective build guides for each of the platforms
can be found in the further sections. The active platform can be chosen by selecting the appropriate 
value for the ACTIVE_PLATFORM macro in the app_config.h (Default is mbed)

Example: #define ACTIVE_PLATFORM STM32_PLATFORM would enable the firmware to compile using the STM32 platform.

The interface used for communicating with PC based IIO clients is either Virtual Serial Or UART. 
IIO Firmware leverages the ADI created no-os and platform driver software layers
to communicates with IIO device.

====================
Hardware Connections
====================

Required: SDP-K1 (or alternative Mbed enabled controller board, or an STM32 board ), EVAL-AD7134 board
and USB cable.

Connect the EVAL-AD7134 board to SDP-K1 board (or any other Mbed enabled controller 
board or an equivalent STM32 board). Connect controller board to the PC using the USB cable.
