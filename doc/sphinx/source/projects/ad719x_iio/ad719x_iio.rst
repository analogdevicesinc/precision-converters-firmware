Introduction
============

This page gives an overview of using the ARM platforms supported (default is Mbed) 
firmware example with Analog Devices AD719x Evaluation board and SDP-K1 controller board. 
This example code leverages the ADI developed IIO (Industrial Input Output) ecosystem to 
evaluate the AD719x device by providing a device debug and data capture support.

The interface used for communicating with PC based IIO clients is either Virtual Serial Or UART. 
IIO Firmware leverages the ADI created no-os and platform driver software layers
to communicates with IIO device.

====================
Hardware Connections
====================

Required: SDP-K1 (or alternative Mbed enabled controller board), EVAL-AD719x board
and USB cable.

Connect the EVAL-AD719x board to SDP-K1 board (or any other Mbed enabled controller 
board) using jumper wires. Connect SDP-K1 board to the PC using the USB cable.

===============
Jumper Settings
===============

**SDP-K1:**

Connect the VIO_ADJUST jumper on the SDP-K1 board to 3.3V position to drive SDP-K1 GPIOs at 3.3V

**EVAL-AD719X:**

* Stack the EVAL-AD719X-ASDZ on the Arduino connectors of the SDP-K1 board.
* Connect a male-to-male jumper wire between D8 and D12 on Arduino connectors.
* Set the LK7 and LK8 jumper headers to 3.3V.
* Set LK12 jumper header to position
