Analog Devices Inc. Precision Converters Firmware Applications

This repository contains embedded firmware applications for Analog Devices 
Precision Converters. The firmware applications are developed to interface with 
Precision Converters (ADCs/DACs) in order to configure/access device parameters 
and capture device data over a serial communication link. These applications are 
primarily targeted for the SDP-k1 hardware platform, running Mbed OS, however 
they can target other platforms as well. `See Understanding No-OS and Platform Drivers <https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/understanding-and-using-the-no-os-and-platform-drivers.html>`_
