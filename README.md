Firmware Applications

This repository contains an embedded firmware applications for Analog Devices
Precision Converters. The firmware applications are developed to interface with
Precision Converters (ADCs/DACs) in order to configure/access device parameters
and capture device data over a serial communication link. These applications
are primarily targeted for the Mbed (SDP-K1) platform, however they can easily
target other platforms as well (see [Understanding No-OS and
Platform Drivers](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/understanding-and-using-the-no-os-and-platform-drivers.html)).

For more information about Precision Converters software support see the [ADI Wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/product-support-software).
